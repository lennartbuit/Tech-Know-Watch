/**
 * Create your watch here. Exercises:
 *
 * 1. Orient yourself around this repository.
 *
 * There are 7 components for watch building:
 *    1. Case
 *    2. Dial
 *    3. Hand
 *    4. Markers
 *    5. Numerals
 *    6. Pusher
 *    7. Logo
 *
 * There are 2 other components you will not need in your watch:
 *    1. Backdrop
 *    2. Greeting
 *
 * Each of these components has its own folder and come with documentation
 * about its slots, attributes and css properties in its main TypeScript file.
 *
 * The backdrop and dial components also accept a `palette` attribute that
 * change their color scheme.
 *
 * Useful resources:
 *   1. Possible palettes - `styles/palette.ts`.
 *
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * 2. Create a time-only watch.
 *
 * Show the time with three hands on the main dial. Note that mechanical
 * watches show time in sweeping fashion, so the seconds hand glides across
 * the dial, and the minute/hour hands also rotate continually.
 *
 * Useful resources:
 *   1. `setInterval` - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setInterval
 *   2. `requestAnimationFrame` - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame
 *
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * 3. Create a watch that conditionally shows seconds in a subdial.
 *
 * Extend your watch to show running seconds in a subdial at the 6 o'clock
 * position. Also add a pusher at the 10 o'clock position that toggles between
 * showing the running seconds with the main hand or showing running seconds
 * in a subdial.
 *
 * Useful resources:
 *  1. Lit `when` directive -  https://lit.dev/docs/templates/directives/#when
 *
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * 4. Create a watch with a chronograph as secondary function.
 *
 * Your watch should be extended so that it can measure elapsed time.
 *
 * Use the:
 *   1. Main second hand for the running seconds of the chronograph function.
 *   2. Subdial at 9 o'clock for the running seconds of the time function.
 *   3. Subdial at 3 o'clock for 0-30 minutes of the chronograph function.
 *   4. Subdial at 9 o'clock for 0-12 hours of the chronograph function.
 *   5. Pusher at 2 o'clock for starting and pausing the chronograph function.
 *   6. Pusher at 4 o'clock for resetting the chronograph function.
 *
 * Useful resources:
 *   1. Lit controllers - https://lit.dev/docs/composition/controllers/
 *
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * 5. Build an additional complication.
 *
 * You completed the workshop ðŸŽ‰. If you got all inspired, there are plenty of
 * complications you can still add. For example:
 *
 *   1. Add a pulsometer track on the cases bezel to quickly determine
 *      heartbeat by measuring elapsed time of 15 or 30 beats.
 *   2. Add a pusher at the 8 o'clock position to change the palette used by
 *      the watch. You can also emit an event when a watch swaps its palette
 *      so that backdrop does the same!
