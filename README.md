# Nedap Tech Know Watch Demo

This repository contains a design system consisting of components to create
watches.

This template is generated from the `lit-starter-ts` package in [the main Lit
repo](https://github.com/lit/lit).

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Build

This sample uses the TypeScript compiler to produce JavaScript that runs in modern browsers.

To build the JavaScript version of your component:

```bash
yarn run build
```

To watch files and rebuild when the files are modified, run the following command in a separate shell:

```bash
yarn run build:watch
```

## Dev Server

While building takes care of converting TypeScript to JavaScript, the Dev Server will statically serve `index.html` as a playground for your component. To run the dev server:

```bash
yarn run serve
```

## Browser support

The repo was tested in the latest version of the three largest browsers: Safari, Firefox and Chrome.

## Editing

We strongly advise you to use VS Code, there is also a lit plugin that will be suggested once you open this workspace in VS Code.
